# Huffman-Compression-Algorithm

## Implementation of Huffman Coding using Python

Introduction:

> This project implements file compression and decompression based on Huffman Coding. Huffman Coding is majorly used for lossless data compression.

### Dependencies:

Install the module(Progress) before running the program.

```
python -m pip install alive-progress
```

### Steps to Run the program:

1. Clone the above repository.
2. In Folder(filesToCompress) place the files that you want to compress.
3. In File(index.py) on **Line34** enter the file name to be compressed.
4. Execute the python file **index.py**.

   ```
   open cmd/terminal and type "python index.py".
   ```

5. Compressed file will be stored in the below directory

   ```
   compressedFiles > fileName.bin
   ```

6. The above file would be decompressed and stored in the below directory

   ```
   deCompressedFiles > fileName_decompressed
   ```
